Problems:
* rpm and deb releases are treated differently:
  - rpm: source rpm
  - deb: binary deb


Two major commands:

 $ make test-deb
 $ make test-rpm


test-deb:
* prepare the environment for building
* make a debian package
* upload the pkg to packagecloud repository
* try install it by using the repository and run a simple test

test-rpm
* prepare the environment for building srpm
* make a srpm package
* upload the srpm pkg to packagecloud repository
* obtain srpm from repository, and run rpmbuild to create
  binary rpms
* upload binary rpms to packagecloud repo
* try install binary rpm by using the repository and run a simple test




Old documentation:

To build src rpm:

 $ git clone <repo>/<pkg>
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake ../<pkg>
 $ (sudo) make build-srpm

src rpm will be in docker/srpm/build/SRPMS/

Upload it to release site.

Then test the src rpm by

 $ (sudo) make test-srpm
